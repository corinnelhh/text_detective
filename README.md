text_detective
==============

Takes in a text sample; if the sample is at least 100 words in length provides a profile of the author based on writing style. 

Uses the bag-of-words model with TF/IDF term weighting.

Currently returns author gender with approximately 70% accuracy.

Basic app is deployed here: http://ec2-54-68-86-232.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

To run the app yourself, clone the repo, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run views.py.

Feel free to suggest additional features for analysis!
